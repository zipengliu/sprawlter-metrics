The computational pipeline for AS metrics
===

* `as_metrics.py`: main script to compute the AS metrics and also the count-based metrics.
* `geometric.py`: geometric functions used by AS metrics
* `graph-format-conversion/*.{py|ipynb}`: script in Python or Python notebook to convert various graph formats to Tulip, and then to a JSON format that can be read by the main script.
* `analysis/*.ipynb`: scripts to analyze computational time, parameters, and plot penalty mapping functions.
